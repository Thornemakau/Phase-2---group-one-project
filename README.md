# Overview:
Our project focuses on developing a predictive model to estimate suicide numbers based on socio-economic variables, aiming to provide valuable insights for targeted interventions and informed policy decisions. By leveraging regression analysis, we seek to uncover patterns and relationships within the data that can contribute to a proactive approach in addressing suicide rates.

# Business and Data Understanding

# Objective:
The primary objective is to build a robust regression model that accurately predicts suicide numbers, offering a data-driven perspective on the impact of socio-economic factors.

# Stakeholder Audience
1. Public Health Organizations

 Primary interest in understanding the predictive factors influencing suicide rates.
Benefit from early warnings and targeted strategies to address mental health challenges.

2. Policymakers

 Seek evidence-based insights for developing and implementing policies to address socio-economic contributors to suicide.
Targeted recommendations for resource allocation and intervention planning.

3. Mental Health Professionals

 Utilize the model to identify high-risk areas and populations, aiding in the design of preventative measures and support services.
Leverage insights for tailored mental health interventions.

4. Researchers

 Explore the correlations between socio-economic variables and suicide rates.
Contribute to the body of knowledge on suicide prevention strategies.

# Key Questions Explored:
- *What socio-economic factors significantly impact suicide rates?*
- *Can a predictive model serve as an effective early warning system?*
- *How can insights from the model inform evidence-based policies and resource allocation?*

This project serves as a collaborative effort, aligning with the goals of diverse stakeholders involved in public health, policy development, mental health support, and academic research. By addressing these questions, we aim to empower stakeholders with actionable insights, ultimately contributing to the collective effort in preventing suicides and promoting mental well-being.

# Modeling Approach:

# Data Preparation
*Handling Missing Data:* We addressed any missing values in the dataset through removal, ensuring a complete dataset.
*Data Cleaning:* Ensuring consistency and accuracy in our dataset, addressing outliers and potential data inconsistencies.

# Feature Selection:
We identified relevant independent variables which were,   based on domain knowledge and correlation analysis with the target variable which is Suicide numbers.

# 3.Train-Test Split
We split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. 

# 4. Model Selection
Finally after adentifying thevariables, we came up with a multiple regression model suitable for predicting numerical outcomes

# 5. Model Training
Trained the  model on the training dataset using the features and the target variable.

# 6. Model Evaluation
We evaluated the model's performance on the testing set using the following metrics:
*Mean Squared Error (MSE):* To measure the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
*R-squared:* To indicate the proportion of the variance in the target variable explained by the model.

# 7. Interpretation and Insights
These coefficients indicate the direction and strength of the relationship between each independent variable and the target variable.

    *Constant*
This is the intercept term. When all other independent variables are zero, the predicted value of Suicides number would be approximately -2480.1371

    *Infant deaths*
-For every additional unit increase in Infant deaths, the model predicts an increase of approximately 213.4422 in the number of suicides, holding other variables constant.
Insight: An increase in the number of Infant deaths is associated with an increase in predicted suicide numbers.
Interpretation: This suggests a potential connection between the infant mortality rate and suicide numbers. It's essential to investigate the socio-economic factors contributing to both infant mortality and suicide rates.
     
     *Alcohol*
-For every additional unit increase in Alcohol consumption, the model predicts an increase of approximately 61.6905 in the number of suicides, holding other variables constant.
Insight: Higher levels of Alcohol consumption are associated with an increase in predicted suicide numbers.
Interpretation: This highlights a positive relationship between alcohol consumption and suicide rates. Efforts to address alcohol-related issues and promote responsible drinking may have an impact on suicide prevention.

    *Under-five deaths*
-For every additional unit increase in Under-five deaths, the model predicts an increase of approximately 649.8999 in the number of suicides, holding other variables constant.
Insight: An increase in the number of Under-five deaths is associated with a substantial increase in predicted suicide numbers.
Interpretation: This indicates a potential link between child mortality and suicide rates. Socio-economic conditions affecting child health may also contribute to the overall mental health of a population.
    
    *Schooling*
-For every additional unit increase in Schooling, the model predicts an increase of approximately 157.4198 in the number of suicides, holding other variables constant.
Insight: Higher levels of Schooling are associated with an increase in predicted suicide numbers.
Interpretation: This finding may be counterintuitive. It's crucial to explore the underlying factors contributing to the positive relationship between schooling and suicide rates. For example, socio-economic stressors or mental health challenges within the education system.

# 8. Communication of Results

The model suggests that factors related to mortality (Infant deaths, Under-five deaths) have a positive association with suicide numbers.
Alcohol consumption, a known risk factor for mental health issues, is also positively associated with suicide rates.
The positive relationship with Schooling requires deeper exploration to understand the nuanced factors influencing suicide numbers in regions with higher levels of education.
