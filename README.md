# Overview:
Our project focuses on developing a predictive model to estimate suicide numbers based on socio-economic variables, aiming to provide valuable insights for targeted interventions and informed policy decisions. By leveraging regression analysis, we seek to uncover patterns and relationships within the data that can contribute to a proactive approach in addressing suicide rates.

# Business and Data Understanding

# Objective:
The primary objective is to build a robust regression model that accurately predicts suicide numbers, offering a data-driven perspective on the impact of socio-economic factors.

# Stakeholder Audience
1. Public Health Organizations

 Primary interest in understanding the predictive factors influencing suicide rates.
Benefit from early warnings and targeted strategies to address mental health challenges.

2. Policymakers

 Seek evidence-based insights for developing and implementing policies to address socio-economic contributors to suicide.
Targeted recommendations for resource allocation and intervention planning.

3. Mental Health Professionals

 Utilize the model to identify high-risk areas and populations, aiding in the design of preventative measures and support services.
Leverage insights for tailored mental health interventions.

4. Researchers

 Explore the correlations between socio-economic variables and suicide rates.
Contribute to the body of knowledge on suicide prevention strategies.

# Key Questions Explored:
- *What socio-economic factors significantly impact suicide rates?*
- *Can a predictive model serve as an effective early warning system?*
- *How can insights from the model inform evidence-based policies and resource allocation?*

This project serves as a collaborative effort, aligning with the goals of diverse stakeholders involved in public health, policy development, mental health support, and academic research. By addressing these questions, we aim to empower stakeholders with actionable insights, ultimately contributing to the collective effort in preventing suicides and promoting mental well-being.

# Modeling Approach:

# Data Preparation
*Handling Missing Data:* We addressed any missing values in the dataset through removal, ensuring a complete dataset.
*Data Cleaning:* Ensuring consistency and accuracy in our dataset, addressing outliers and potential data inconsistencies.

# Feature Selection:
We identified relevant independent variables which were,   based on domain knowledge and correlation analysis with the target variable which is Suicide numbers.
