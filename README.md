# Key Questions Explored:
- *What socio-economic factors significantly impact suicide rates?*
- *Can a predictive model serve as an effective early warning system?*
- *How can insights from the model inform evidence-based policies and resource allocation?*

This project serves as a collaborative effort, aligning with the goals of diverse stakeholders involved in public health, policy development, mental health support, and academic research. By addressing these questions, we aim to empower stakeholders with actionable insights, ultimately contributing to the collective effort in preventing suicides and promoting mental well-being.

# *Modeling Approach:

# Data Preparation
*Handling Missing Data:* We addressed any missing values in the dataset through removal, ensuring a complete dataset.
*Data Cleaning:* Ensuring consistency and accuracy in our dataset, addressing outliers and potential data inconsistencies.

# Feature Selection
We identified relevant independent variables which were,   based on domain knowledge and correlation analysis with the target variable which is Suicide numbers.

# Train-Test Split
We split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. 

# Model Selection
Finally after adentifying thevariables, we came up with a multiple regression model suitable for predicting numerical outcomes. The model is
Predicted Suicides number= âˆ’2394.5502 + 210.5530Infant deaths + 59.2438Alcohol + 643.8080Under-five deaths + 153.1249Schooling + 74.5680Population 
This equation allows for the calculation of the predicted Suicides number by substituting specific values for each variable based on the model's coefficient

# Model Training
Trained the  model on the training dataset using the features and the target variable.

# Model Evaluation
We evaluated the model's performance on the testing set using the following metrics:
*Mean Squared Error (MSE):* To measure the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
*Improved R-squared:* To indicate the proportion of the variance in the target variable explained by the model.We got it to be 0.7436. Aan R-squared value of 0.7436 means that approximately 74.36% of the variability in the Suicides number can be explained by the independent variables included in this regression model.

# Interpretation and Insights
These coefficients indicate the direction and strength of the relationship between each independent variable and the target variable.

    *Constant*
This is the intercept term. When all other independent variables are zero, the predicted value of Suicides number would be approximately -2394.5502 

    *Infant deaths*
-For every additional unit increase in Infant deaths, the model predicts an increase of approximately 210.5530 in the number of suicides, holding other variables constant.
Insight: An increase in the number of Infant deaths is associated with an increase in predicted suicide numbers.
Interpretation: This suggests a potential connection between the infant mortality rate and suicide numbers. It's essential to investigate the socio-economic factors contributing to both infant mortality and suicide rates.
     
     *Alcohol*
-For every additional unit increase in Alcohol consumption, the model predicts an increase of approximately 59.2438 in the number of suicides, holding other variables constant.
Insight: Higher levels of Alcohol consumption are associated with an increase in predicted suicide numbers.
Interpretation: This highlights a positive relationship between alcohol consumption and suicide rates. Efforts to address alcohol-related issues and promote responsible drinking may have an impact on suicide prevention.

    *Under-five deaths*
-For every additional unit increase in Under-five deaths, the model predicts an increase of approximately 643.8080 in the number of suicides, holding other variables constant.
Insight: An increase in the number of Under-five deaths is associated with a substantial increase in predicted suicide numbers.
Interpretation: This indicates a potential link between child mortality and suicide rates. Socio-economic conditions affecting child health may also contribute to the overall mental health of a population.
    
    *Schooling*
-For every additional unit increase in Schooling, the model predicts an increase of approximately 157.4198 in the number of suicides, holding other variables constant.
Insight: Higher levels of Schooling are associated with an increase in predicted suicide numbers.
Interpretation: This finding may be counterintuitive. It's crucial to explore the underlying factors contributing to the positive relationship between schooling and suicide rates. For example, socio-economic stressors or mental health challenges within the education system.

    *Population*
-For every one-unit increase in Population, we expect an increase of 74.5680 units in the number of suicides, holding other variables constant.
Insight: Higher levels of Population are associated with an increase in predicted suicide numbers.
Interpretation: This observation suggests that as the population increases, the predicted number of suicides also tends to rise. Larger populations might have higher absolute numbers of suicides.

# Communication of Results And Conclusion

The multiple linear regression model developed for predicting Suicides number provides valuable insights into the relationships between socio-economic factors and suicide rates. The analysis considered soci-economic and health variables, that is,  Infant deaths, Alcohol, Under-five deaths, Population, and  Schooling. The model's coefficients offer quantitative interpretations of the impact of each variable on the predicted 'Suicides number.

Interpreting the coefficients, an increase in Infant deaths, Alcohol, Under-five deaths, Population, or Schooling is associated with corresponding increases in the predicted Suicides number, while holding other variables constant. The prediction equation provides a tool for calculating predicted values based on specific input values.

This regression analysis aligns with the objectives of diverse stakeholders, including public health organizations, policymakers, mental health professionals, and researchers, by offering evidence-based insights into the socio-economic factors influencing suicide rates. As an ongoing collaborative effort, the aim is to empower stakeholders with actionable information for addressing mental health challenges and formulating effective strategies for prevention.


# Recommendations
 
 Implement targeted mental health awareness programs, particularly in regions where higher 'Infant deaths' and 'Under-five deaths' are observed. These programs should address the unique challenges associated with health-related indicators.
 
 Develop evidence-based policies to address alcohol consumption, considering the significant impact identified by the 'Alcohol' variable in the analysis. This may involve regulatory measures and public awareness campaigns targeting areas with higher 
 
Invest in education and skill development initiatives, leveraging the positive association between 'Schooling' and predicted 'Suicides number.' Such initiatives can empower individuals and communities, potentially contributing to improved mental well-being

Implement interventions and support services in areas with higher populations, acknowledging the influence of 'Population' on suicide rates. Tailored strategies can address the unique socio-economic dynamics of densely populated regions.

Encourage collaboration among public health organizations, policymakers, mental health professionals, educators, and researchers. This interdisciplinary approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of the socio-economic factors influencing suicide rates and facilitates the development of effective strategies.

Establish a systematic process for regular monitoring and evaluation of implemented interventions and policies. This ongoing assessment will provide insights into the effectiveness of strategies and allow for timely adjustments based on evolving socio-economic dynamics
